-=== SparkSnake by Jackjan ===-

SparkSnake was developed with Visual Studio 2013 and is written in C# (.NET 4.5.1).

Feel free to modify the source as you want. It's fully documented but it's not the cleanest code. (I wrote the game in a few hours)

ATTENTION: To build the project the LogitechLedEnginesWrapper.dll needs to be in the folder where your .exe is build or the program won't run!
